# Operator Counter

A Java-based program to analyze C++ source code and count different types of operators (single, binary, and ternary) while excluding comments, string literals, and unnecessary directives.

## Features

- **Single Operators**: Counts operators like `++`, `--`, `!`, `~`, `&`, `*`, `+`, and `-`.
- **Binary Operators**: Tracks operators such as `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=`, `&&`, and `||`.
- **Ternary Operators**: Identifies occurrences of the `?:` operator.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleans the input by removing comments, string literals, and `#include` directives to ensure accurate counting.
